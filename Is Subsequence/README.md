<h1>Is Subsequence</h1>

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if `s` is a __subsequence__ of `t`, or `false` otherwise_.

A __subsequence__ of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

__Example 1:__
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 ```

__Constraints:__

- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
