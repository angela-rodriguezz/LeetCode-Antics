<h1>Remove Duplicates from Sorted List</h1>

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list __sorted__ as well._

 <hr>

__Example 1:__
```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
 ```

__Constraints:__

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be __sorted__ in ascending order.
