<h1>Reverse Linked List</h1>

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return _the reversed list_.

<hr>

__Example 1:__
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
__Example 3:__
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

__Constraints:__

- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
