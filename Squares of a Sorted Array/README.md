<h1>Squares of a Sorted Array</h1>

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in __non-decreasing__ order, return _an array of __the squares of each number__ sorted in non-decreasing order_.

<hr> 

__Example 1:__
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 ```

__Constraints:__

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in __non-decreasing__ order.
