<h1>Diameter of Binary Tree</h1>

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the __diameter__ of the tree_.

The __diameter__ of a binary tree is the __length__ of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.

The __length__ of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

<hr>

__Example 1:__
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

__Constraints:__

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
